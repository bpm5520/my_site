### Beginning the Game

The beginning of the game is straight forward. You are introduced to the robot E.D.I.E who has crash landed in the starting base. Talking to him begins your list of tasks to complete and introduce you into the game. E.D.I.E. starts off by tasking the player to get wood, water, seeds, and other resources required to make and sustain a base, as well as introduces players to concepts like selling goods and fighting enemies in the wasteland.
