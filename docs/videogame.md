# Sand: A Superfluous Game

Sand is an open world game set in a desert landscape set in a post-apocalyptic Alaska. The game focuses around base building, keeping track of resources, participating in quests and exploring the wasteland to progress through the story and advance in the game. This game is not finished yet, but the few missions that are currently in the game are fun and engaging for the player.

### Graphics and World Building
The graphics style in Sand is 8-bit and a top down, 2D experience, reminiscient of old RPG games. This game has tons of options to build your base and world, from wood and stone walls and furniture, up to metal and advanced technologies as the game progresses. Neighboring tiles see the enemies come to life as you have to fight tooth and nail with your trusty dog companion to fend off the groups that attack you, as well as cities and buildings that speckle the wasteland. Performing missions and expanding your base add to the immersion of the world, as upgrades to your own firepower and your bases defenses help keep you protected from the enemy raids and the enemies in the open world of other tiles.
