### About Me

<img src="images/Professional.jpg" alt="Picture of Myself" width="200"/>

I am a sophomore studying at Penn State Behrend for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have a decent knowledge of C++ and Java code due to the classes I have taken so far at Penn State. The most experience I have in a professional programming job is being one of two programmers on my FIRST Tech Challenge team 2 years ago in high school, where we used the Java coding language to create two seperate modes of transportation for the robot, an autonomous movement and a user-controlled one. I currently hold a 3.96 GPA after my first year of college, and hope to continue that into the Sophomore year at Penn State Behrend.
